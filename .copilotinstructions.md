# Copilot Instructions for Tax System Modernization Demo

## Project Context
This is a demonstration project showcasing the modernization of a legacy 1985 COBOL tax calculation system to modern Java. The demo focuses on:

1. **Legacy Code Understanding**: Explaining 40-year-old COBOL business logic
2. **Safe Modernization**: Translating COBOL to Java while preserving tax law compliance
3. **Security Enhancement**: Identifying and fixing vulnerabilities in financial systems
4. **Developer Productivity**: Accelerating junior developer onboarding in complex tax domains

## Domain Knowledge

### Tax Calculation Fundamentals
- **Progressive Tax Brackets**: Federal tax rates increase with income levels (10%, 12%, 22%, 24%)
- **Standard vs Itemized Deductions**: Taxpayers choose the higher of standard deduction or itemized deductions
- **Filing Status**: Single, Married Filing Jointly, Head of Household (affects deduction amounts)
- **State Tax Variance**: Some states have no income tax (TX, FL), others have significant rates (CA: 9.25%, NY: 6.85%)

### Legacy System (TAX-CALC.cbl)
- Written in 1985, processes millions of tax returns annually
- Uses COBOL financial data types (PIC 9(8)V99 for currency)
- Critical business logic in CALCULATE-FEDERAL-TAX and CALCULATE-STATE-TAX sections
- File processing: sequential input/output for batch processing
- Institutional knowledge at risk due to retiring COBOL developers

### Modern Implementation (Java)
- Uses BigDecimal for financial precision (critical for tax calculations)
- Enum-based filing status for type safety
- Strategy pattern for extensible state tax calculations
- Comprehensive input validation and error handling
- Unit testable design suitable for regulatory compliance

## Code Generation Guidelines

### When explaining COBOL code:
- Focus on business logic and tax law compliance aspects
- Explain the significance of financial data precision
- Highlight institutional knowledge embedded in the code
- Relate COBOL constructs to modern programming concepts

### When translating COBOL to Java:
- Always use BigDecimal for financial calculations (never float/double)
- Preserve the exact tax bracket logic and calculations
- Add comprehensive input validation
- Include clear comments referencing original COBOL sections
- Follow tax domain naming conventions (taxableIncome, standardDeduction, etc.)

### When generating tests:
- Include edge cases for tax law (zero income, bracket boundaries)
- Test all filing status scenarios
- Verify financial precision (exact penny calculations)
- Cover state tax variations
- Include negative test cases for validation

### Security Considerations:
- Never log PII (SSNs, names) or financial data in production code
- Use parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection
- Implement strong encryption for sensitive data (AES-256, not DES)
- Avoid hard-coded credentials or encryption keys
- Follow financial industry security standards

## Demo-Specific Instructions

### For legacy code explanations:
- Emphasize the business value and complexity of tax law implementation
- Highlight the risk of losing institutional knowledge
- Explain how the code handles real-world tax scenarios

### For modernization suggestions:
- Show how modern Java improves maintainability while preserving logic
- Demonstrate type safety benefits
- Suggest testing strategies for regulatory compliance

### For security fixes:
- Provide secure alternatives to vulnerable patterns
- Explain the compliance implications of security issues
- Show industry best practices for financial systems

## Target Audience
- **Primary**: CIO David Roseberry (business value, ROI, risk mitigation)
- **Secondary**: Development teams (technical implementation, best practices)
- **Context**: Government agency modernizing critical tax infrastructure

## Success Metrics
- Knowledge transfer from COBOL to Java developers
- Reduced security vulnerabilities in modernized code
- Accelerated development velocity (30-55% improvement expected)
- Preserved tax law compliance throughout modernization
