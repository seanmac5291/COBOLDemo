### üí¨ COPILOT CHAT COMMANDS (Copy/Paste These)

1. `Explain what this COBOL program does and why it's important for tax processing`

2. `Convert this COBOL tax calculation logic to modern Java using BigDecimal for financial precision`

3. `Fix the SQL injection vulnerability in this method using prepared statements`

4. `I'm a junior Java developer new to tax software. Explain how progressive tax brackets work and why the calculation is complex`

5. `Generate comprehensive JUnit tests for this tax calculation method including edge cases`

### üîß VS CODE SHORTCUTS

### üÜò IF SOMETHING BREAKS

**Copilot Chat not working?**
- Say: "Let me try a different approach"
- Use inline completions instead
- Focus on code comparison

**Files not opening?**
- Show in any text editor
- Keep talking about business value
- Use backup talking points

**Internet down?**
- "Normally Copilot would explain this instantly..."
