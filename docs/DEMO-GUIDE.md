## ðŸŽ¬ DEMO SCRIPT (15 minutes max)

### OPENING (1 minute)

**Say this EXACTLY:**
> "Today I want to show you how GitHub's AI platform can solve your exact challenge: modernizing 40-year-old tax systems while your COBOL experts retire. We'll see three things: understanding legacy code, modernizing it safely, and ensuring security compliance."

---

### DEMO PART 1: Legacy Code Understanding (4 minutes)

**Step 1: Open the Legacy COBOL File**
1. In VS Code Explorer, click `legacy-cobol` folder
2. Click `TAX-CALC.cbl`
3. **Say:** "This is a realistic 1985 COBOL tax calculator. Let's say your retiring expert wrote this."

**Step 2: Get Copilot to Explain the Code**
1. Press `Ctrl+Shift+I` (or `Cmd+Shift+I` on Mac) to open Copilot Chat
2. Type EXACTLY: `Explain what this COBOL program does and why it's important for tax processing`
3. Press Enter
4. **Wait for response** (should take 10-20 seconds)
5. **Say:** "Look - Copilot instantly understands 40-year-old business logic. Your junior Java developers can now understand what the retiring COBOL expert built."
6. **Optional advanced point:** "Notice how Copilot understands tax terminology and business context - that's because we've provided it with domain-specific instructions in our `.copilotinstructions.md` file. This shows how GitHub Copilot can be customized for your specific business domain."

**Step 3: Deep Dive into Tax Logic**
1. Scroll down to line 107 (the `CALCULATE-FEDERAL-TAX` section)
2. Select lines 107-140 (the entire federal tax calculation logic)
3. Right-click â†’ "Copilot: Explain This"
4. **Say:** "This is the complex progressive tax bracket logic. Watch Copilot break it down..."
5. **Wait for explanation**
6. **Say:** "This is how you preserve institutional knowledge before it walks out the door."

---

### DEMO PART 2: Modernization (4 minutes)

**Step 4: Show the Modern Java Version**
1. Click `modern-java` folder in Explorer
2. Click `TaxCalculationService.java`
3. **Say:** "Here's the same tax logic modernized to Java. Notice the comments referencing the original COBOL sections."

**Step 5: Demonstrate Code Translation**
1. Go back to the COBOL file (`TAX-CALC.cbl`)
2. Select the `CALCULATE-FEDERAL-TAX` section again (lines 107-140)
3. Use Copilot Chat in Agent mode for enhanced capabilities
   - Click the agent dropdown (sparkle icon) in Copilot Chat
   - Select "@workspace" to give Copilot full context of your project
4. In Copilot Chat with type: `Convert this COBOL tax calculation logic to modern Java using BigDecimal for financial precision. Maintain all business rules and tax brackets exactly.`
5. Press Enter
6. **Wait for response** (agent mode may take 45-90 seconds for thorough analysis)
7. **Say:** "Notice how GitHub Copilot's agent mode understands the entire codebase context - it's not just translating line by line, but understanding the full tax calculation architecture."
8. **Key points to highlight:**
   - Agent mode provides more comprehensive solutions
   - It considers the existing Java structure in your project
   - Suggests integration points with your modern services
   - Maintains financial precision critical for tax calculations
9. **If time allows**: Ask follow-up: `@workspace How would this integrate with the existing TaxCalculationService?`

**Step 6: Compare Results**
1. Open both files side by side (View â†’ Editor Layout â†’ Two Columns)
2. Put COBOL on left, Java on right
3. **Say:** "Same business logic, modern implementation. Your tax rules are preserved but now maintainable by your Java team."

---

### DEMO PART 3: Security Scanning (3 minutes)

**Step 7: Show Security Vulnerabilities**
1. Open `TaxDataService.java`
2. Scroll to line 26 (hard-coded password)
3. **Say:** "This file has intentional security issues typical in legacy modernization."
4. Point out:
   - Line 26: `DB_PASSWORD = "password123"`
   - Line 45: SQL injection in query building
   - Line 81: Weak DES encryption

**Step 8: Get Security Fixes from Copilot**
1. Select lines 43-61 (the getTaxpayerById method with SQL injection)
2. In Copilot Chat, type: `Fix the SQL injection vulnerability in this method using prepared statements`
3. Press Enter
4. **Say:** "Copilot suggests secure coding practices automatically during modernization."

**Step 9: Show GitHub Advanced Security (if available)**
1. If you have this in a GitHub repo, show the Security tab
2. **Say:** "GitHub Advanced Security automatically scans every commit for these issues."
3. **Backup if no repo:** "In production, GitHub would flag all these vulnerabilities automatically."

---

### DEMO PART 4: Developer Productivity (2 minutes)

**Step 10: Junior Developer Scenario**
1. In Copilot Chat, type: `I'm a junior Java developer new to tax software. Explain how progressive tax brackets work and why the calculation is complex`
2. Press Enter
3. **Say:** "Your junior developers get instant domain expertise."

**Step 11: Generate Unit Tests**
1. Go to `TaxCalculationService.java`
2. Scroll to the `calculateFederalTax` method (around line 134)
3. Select the entire method (lines 134-150)
4. In Copilot Chat, type: `Generate comprehensive JUnit tests for this tax calculation method including edge cases`
5. **Say:** "Copilot generates tests that cover tax law edge cases your team might miss."

---

### CLOSING & Q&A (1 minute)

**Say this EXACTLY:**
> "This is how GitHub solves your exact modernization challenge: Copilot preserves retiring expertise, Advanced Security ensures compliance, and the platform accelerates your Java team. Your 40 years of tax logic becomes a competitive advantage, not a liability."

## ðŸ†˜ EMERGENCY BACKUP PLANS

### If Copilot Chat Doesn't Work:
1. **Stay calm** - say "Let me try a different approach"
2. Use inline completions instead:
   - Go to end of any Java method
   - Start typing a comment like `// This method calculates...`
   - Copilot should suggest completions
3. **Fallback explanation:** "Copilot helps in multiple ways - through chat, code completion, and explanation tooltips"

### If Code Files Don't Open:
1. **Check file extensions** - make sure VS Code recognizes them
2. **Backup plan:** Show the code in any text editor
3. **Keep talking:** Focus on the business value while fixing technical issues

### If Internet/Copilot is Down:
1. **Prepared talking points:**
   - "Normally Copilot would explain this COBOL instantly..."
   - "In a live environment, you'd see security vulnerabilities highlighted..."
   - "The AI would generate tests covering tax law edge cases..."
2. **Focus on the code comparison** between COBOL and Java
3. **Emphasize the business problem** you're solving
